### About Me

University instruction in the United States of America increasingly
	demands technology.

Is the technology a tool? Is it becoming grafted into our pedagogy
	such that we are bionic? Are we becoming Borg? As a University
	Professor I think about the tools I use for delivery of content,
	and I think about how they are used.

I often wish the tools were better, or easier to use. My impression
	is that today many learners cannot understand why University
	instructors don't deliver more flash, wow, pop, bang, and glitz.

The learner of today is surrounded and bombarded by very polished and
	often sophisticated sales pitches but at Universities we
	generally are using technologies from 200 to 400 years ago.

A good story told in person is powerful. We learn much by discourse.
	Personally, I believe that the great technology of the Gutenberg
	press is still important, but can it be augmented? I use
	technology. Technology bits and bytes are tools. I get a little
	wrapped up in what they can do. Am I becoming Professor Borg? Is
	resistance to technology futile?
	
### Academic Interests

I am an environmental scientist with a strong foundation in soil
	morphology, soil characterization, and soil mineralogy. I am
	interested in identifying systematic variation in soil morphology
	using relationships with climate, vegetation, geomorphology, and
	geology. By studying the evolution of soils (a very slowly
	renewable resource), relationships vital to addressing landscape
	scale issues are better understood. Soil in the environment and
	of the environment. Thinking about and studying soil in these two
	ways allows us to apply knowledge to site-specific soil
	management including land use(s) for agricultural, and land
	use(s) for non-agricultural soil(s). In addition, understanding
	soil is also vital to to the conservation of many other natural
	resources.
	
### Tenure

I am a Professor of Soil Science at Tarleton State University in Texas USA.
