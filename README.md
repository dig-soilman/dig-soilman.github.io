I am an environmental scientist with a strong foundation in soil
	morphology, soil characterization, and soil mineralogy. I am interested 
  in identifying systematic variation in soil morphology using
	relationships with climate, vegetation, geomorphology, and
	geology. By studying the evolution of soils (a very slowly
	renewable resource), relationships vital to addressing landscape
	scale issues are better understood. Soil in the environment and
	of the environment. Thinking about and studying soil in these two
	ways allows us to apply knowledge to site-specific soil
	management including land use(s) for agricultural, and land
	use(s) for non-agricultural soil(s). In addition, understanding
	soil is also vital to to the conservation of many other natural
	resources.
