## About Me

From a previous web sites August 29, 2013 at 4:48 pm and now no
	longer online.

University instruction in the United States of America increasingly
	demands technology.

Is the technology a tool? Is it becoming grafted into our pedagogy
	such that we are bionic? Are we becoming Borg? As a University
	Professor I think about the tools I use for delivery of content,
	and I think about how they are used.

I often wish the tools were better, or easier to use. My impression
	is that today many learners cannot understand why University
	instructors don't deliver more flash, wow, pop, bang, and glitz.

The learner of today is surrounded and bombarded by very polished and
	often sophisticated sales pitches but at Universities we
	generally are using technologies from 200 to 400 years ago.

A good story told in person is powerful. We learn much by discourse. 
	Personally, I believe that the great technology of the Gutenberg
	press is still important, but can it be augmented? I use
	technology. Technology bits and bytes are tools. I get a little
	wrapped up in what they can do. Am I becoming Professor Borg? Is
	resistance to technology futile?
